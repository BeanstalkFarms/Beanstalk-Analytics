Vega schemas are stored in the `schemas` directory. 

If you would like to visualize the chart that a schema represents, navigate to 
the [vega editor](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/) and copy the schema into the 
editor on the left hand side. 

Sometimes, the chart doesn't show up until you press the *fullscreen* icon in the 
upper right hander corner of the UI, so make sure to try this if you don't see it.
